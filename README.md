# **Computing posterior kernel density mathematically and numerically**

In this post, you'll learn how to compute the posterior distribution of simple and complex models
both mathematically and numerically. Before diving into the
computations, we'll review essential statistical concepts to build a
solid understanding of the posterior and Bayesian inference in general.
We assume that readers are familiar with probability theory, calculus, set theory and the
R programming language.
